# My Final Project - 3D Synth
-- Thid Is My Final Project in iOS And My First App!--

Hello, and welcome to my app! 

I hope you'll find my app fun and useful. 

Some point who might help you to use the app: 

1) Gain on 0 => silence, gain on 1 => normal (no change).

2) Every long vertical rectangle is a step of half tone. 
   for the fix tone frequency - touch on the black line in between the long rectangles. 
   
3) The point of this new kind of instrument is to give you the ability to rich ALL the 
   frequency - absolutely chromatically. This way you can find new tones and new approach to you playing. 
   
4) Because of that, there is a little learning cruve, but it worth it!

5) Because we use to play with 12-tone equal temperament, the tone we use to play are a little 'out of tune'. 
   But here, because you have all the tones, sometimes you'll find yourself playing according to you hears 
   and it not perfectly match (for example the # will be higher and the b will be lower). 
   It's perfectly ok and cool, don't worry. Also, when you will play with fixed playback you will play differently.
   
6) Recording input levels are different from what you hear - you can manage them on record setting. 
Usually you won't need high level and rarely above 1. Do some check before you recording you awesome staff!
7) There is some gain stage deferences with and without the effects, you can manage it with the effect gain.

Thanks again and rock on!
